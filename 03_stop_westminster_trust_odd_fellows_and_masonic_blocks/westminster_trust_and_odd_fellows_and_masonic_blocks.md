The Westminster Trust building is the city's first true skyscraper. Built in 1911-1912 at a cost of $200,000 the building was designed by leading architects Gardiner and Mercer. Consisting of 124 business offices and the Westminster Club, which occupied the top two floors. The building is designed in the style of Chicago School of commercial architecture, with clearly defined base, shaft and capital areas. 

The Odd fellows and Masonic blocks were created by those societies and designed by George Grant in 1887. They burned down twice, once in 1891, with both societies rebuilt on the same spot; and then a second time in 1898 during the Great Fire. The Great Fire left much of the Masonic lodges foundation intact and they were reused in the reconstruction. In 1912, both fraternal societies moved out and the two blocks were joined by realtor F.J. Hart. The building standing there now was designed in the Romanesque Revival Style.

Masonic Block

One of the first buildings in New Westminster, George W. Grant, the architect designed many of the buildings in New Westminster. The building was home to the Masonic Order or the Freemasons. The  Masons are oldest and largest fraternal organization in the world and represent virtually every occupation, profession and ideology.
In the Early 1860's the Masons began meeting on the Masonic Block. They have their own area in the Fraser Cemetery. They would later expand throughout the province. The Masonic Block was one of the first areas to burn down in the great fire in 1898.
