Directions and Duties, Week Two (Final Stretch)

1. First up, I will work through the stop folders and correct the grammar, normalize the formatting, convert anything that needs converting and generally supervise whatever it is you're putting in there. I will do this every evening after 8pm between now and Thursday. You just add the materials and commentary as directed below and whatever else you want to add; I'll handle all the oversight.

2. Friday morning is the drop-dead date for this project. To this end, I would like you both to commit some work--something!!--to the repository each day (Today, Wednesday and Thursday) by 7pm. If you need to Email me the materials, fine, but make sure you note what repo the stuff goes in so I can put it in the right place. You should add materials to whatever stop appeals to you, trying not to leave your own choices dangling in the wind. Please check in every day at 7pm by Email no matter what, so I know what's what. Please feel free to close the lab to do whatever needs to be done with the project... this is the priority this week. Everything you contribute needs to be in the repository by Thursday at 8pm. And please, for the love of crap do not wait until that time to upload everything because I won't have time to edit. A little bit at a time please. 

3. Below is what needs to be addressed before Thursday, assigned to each of you, from really important to not-so-much important, beyond the required elements below, you're free to add whatever you want. Feel free to get in touch with me if you need help navigating the Archives, etc., I can go with you as needed:
	1. Dixon and Megan, ASAP: put the stops in the proper order, we'll start at the Anvil Centre and end at the "Wait For Me, Daddy" Monument at the foot of 8th and Columbia (this can be tied in with the Electric Railway building). This will give us a nice circle, but how people move from one stop to another between those two end-stops is up to you guys. Do this as soon as possible and before anything else. 
	2. Dixon: You'll need to go out there and snap some pics ASAP to get a few wipes of your own in there or head up to the archive to add materials (check website below first, lots of good pics there and directions about where to find originals). MAKE SURE YOU CAPTION THE PICS YOU TAKE, OR MAKE, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT.
	3. Megan: Add a sentence or two to your stops about why YOU feel they are important--not looking for a novel here, a few sentences (2 to 5 at most!). The pasted historical stuff is good, but we need more Megan in there to represent what's interesting about the stop. A good example is how you are clearly interested in the Railway Station hauntings, I can tell from the the emphasis... Why? What's intriguing about it? What else do you want to know? What are you made to think about the stop? For instance, why are there so few archival pictures of the Railway Station? Or Eaton's? I would ask what that might say about how the community responded to these spaces... were they so common that no one really thought to take a picture, whereas the emphasis on the upper part of New West, looking East is the site of the fire, so maybe people wanted to preserve that part because they had a fear of what the fire had taken and might take again. That's a little more in-depth than you'll need to provide, but you get the gist... you could just say something like "the idea that the station is haunted is cool because it reminds me of all the lost souls that might be stuck there." Done!  
	4. Dixon: Same as Megan's (c) above, but speaking to the architectural elements, obvs. 
	5. 3 and 4 above are important because what we have now is a little too "cut and paste" from the other walks. All cool, but I think we need a little of your personal perspective in there. We can do this both by ordering the walk in an interesting way (how many times will they cross Columbia?) and by adding your personal commentary. We need some personal perspective at the stops. Nothing genius, just personal perspective. 
	6. I found this [website](http://www.nwheritage.org/) really useful, particularly in getting some pictures of the buildings. We'll need to caption these to tell people what they are looking at in the picture. Make sure you note the link where you got the picture from in case I need to find it again. No more than 2 pictures per stop unless we're putting together a wipe (or interior shot w/ explanation), then 3 max.
