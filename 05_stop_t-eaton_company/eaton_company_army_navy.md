T. Eaton Company 
Timothy Eaton was the founder of the T. Eaton Company, one of the key retail businesses in Canadian history. 
He introduced Canada to the mail-order catalogue in 1884. The retail empire started in Toronto and later expanded out west. 
The large floor plan and variety of goods is what made the T. Eaton Company so successful.  
The company was force into bankruptcy due to competition from the Hudson Bay and Sears, The T. Eaton Company for force to close. In 1999 the company would be bought by Sears.
In 1954, Army and Navy Department Store moved into the T. Eaton Company building. It will be interesting to see what happeneds to department stores in future.
