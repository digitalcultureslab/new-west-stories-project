Eaton's was a major cultural entity in Canada throughout the 1950s through to the 1980s. A retail department chain that introduced Canada to mail order catalogues, it was one of the first major retail chains in the country. Storefronts such as this one served outlying communities both as a space to purchase goods and as a mail order base of shipments to other parts of the province. 

In 1977, Army and Navy Department Store moved into the T. Eaton Company building. It will be interesting to see what happens to department stores in future.

The lasting impact of department stores in North America remains when even in relatively small enclaves such as New Westminster, there was a major department store servicing the community. Also, the relatively small size of the Eaton's location, but its central location and prominence, speaks to its place as a community hub for a time during from 1950 - 1970. 

Timothy Eaton was the founder of the T. Eaton Company, one of the key retail businesses in Canadian history. He introduced Canada to the mail-order catalogue in 1884. The retail empire started in Toronto and later expanded west. The large floor plan and variety of goods is what made the T. Eaton Company so successful.
