**T. Eaton Company**

Eaton's was a major cultural entity in Canada throughout the 1950s through to the 1980s. A retail department chain that introduced Canada to mail order catalogues, it was one of the first major retail chains in the country. One might say that Eaton's was Canada's first Amazon website. Storefronts such as this one served outlying communities both as a space to purchase goods and as a mail order base of shipments to other parts of the province.

In 1977, the current Army and Navy Department Store moved into the T. Eaton Company building foreshadowing the gradual decline of Eaton's that would lead to its bankruptcy and closure in the late 1990s. 

The lasting impact of department stores in North America remains when even in relatively small enclaves such as New Westminster, there was a major department store servicing the community. Also, the relatively small size of the Eaton's location, but its central location and prominence, speaks to its place as a community hub for a time during from 1950 - 1970.
