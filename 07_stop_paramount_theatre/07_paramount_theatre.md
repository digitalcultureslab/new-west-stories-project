**Edison / Paramount Theatre**

The Paramount Theatre began life as the Edison Theatre, opened when Frank Kerr converted an old building in the Dupont block into a theatre--a common practice at the time because Moving Picture shows were thought to be a fad worth capitalizing on. Admission was 5 cents for children and 10 cents for adults. That fare would buy you continuous movie reels accompanied by an orchestra, with vaudeville acts in-between the shows. When Kerr died in 1948, the theatre was leased to Famous Players and renovated in 1950 to include a new neon marquee and the "Paramount" name. In 1983, the theatre succumbed to competition and closed. 

Today, the theatre is used for a new kind of burlesque entertainment.
