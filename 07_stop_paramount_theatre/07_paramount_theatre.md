Need some historic photos--particularly head on if possible... 

Began life as the Edison Theatre, which was created when Frank Kerr converted an old building in the Dupont block to a theatre, which was common at the time as moving picture shows were thought to be a fad worth capitalizing on. Admission was 5 cents for children and 10 cents for adults. This would buy you continuous movie reels accompanied by an orchestra, with vaudeville acts in-between the shows. When Kerr died in 1948, the theatre was leased to Famous Players and renovated in 1950 to include a new neon marquee and the Paramount name. In 1983, the theatre was killed by competition and closed. 

Today the theatre is used for a new kind of burlesque entertainment.
