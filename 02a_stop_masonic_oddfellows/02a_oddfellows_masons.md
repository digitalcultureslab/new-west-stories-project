**Oddfellows / Masonic Blocks**

Fraternal orders The Oddfellows and Masons funded buildings on this block, first designed by George Grant in 1887. Grant designed many of the early buildings in New Westminster. Buildings belonging to the Oddfellows and Masons burned down twice, once in 1891, with both societies rebuilding on the same spot; and then a second time in 1898 during the Great Fire where this building was one of the earliest to burn. However, after the Great Fire, much of the Masonic Lodge's foundation was left intact and was reused in the reconstruction. In 1912, both fraternal societies moved out and the two blocks were joined by realtor F. J. Hart. The building standing here now was designed in the [Romanesque Revival Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture). One of the Architects, Charlse H. Clow was responsible for rebuilding much of New Westminster after the Great Fire and was a member of the Oddfellows lodge that met here.
