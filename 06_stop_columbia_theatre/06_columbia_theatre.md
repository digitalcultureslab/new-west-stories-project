**The Columbia Theatre**

Originally built in 1927 as a movie theatre, the Columbia theatre opened its doors to the age of film and motion picture entertainment. 

In 1994, a not-for-profit society purchased and restored the theatre and renamed it the Burr Theatre, after Raymond Burr. Burr was born in New Westminster and become a well-known actor in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He is still celebrating in New Westminster on the date of his birthday, May 6th. 

Burr is best known for his role as Perry Mason on the television show of the same name and less so as a murder suspect in Alfred Hitchcock's *Rear Window* (1954) and for his role in the original 1956 *Godzilla: King of Monsters*.

Here's some clips:

New Westminster frequently stands in for other places in Hollywood cinema. Mark Wahlburg drove toward the water through the parking lot overpass to your left in *Transformers* and Will Smith visited parts of a futuristic-looking New Westminster in *I, Robot*.
