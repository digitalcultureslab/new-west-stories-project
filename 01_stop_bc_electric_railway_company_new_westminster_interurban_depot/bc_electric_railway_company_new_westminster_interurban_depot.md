Built in 1910-1911 by the [B.C. Electric Railway Company](http://www.r2parks.net/BCE.html) as the hub for the electric Interurban railway system between Vancouver and Chilliwack. Architects Maclure and Fox modelled its design on the [Indiana Traction Company's station in Indianapolis Indiana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Indianapolis_Traction_and_Terminal_Company%27s_main_Terminal.jpg). Completed at a cost of $100,000, this handsome Edwardian Classical revival styled station was engineered in structural steel to permit the addition of two extra stories in the future. Interurban cars entered diagonally through the building to platforms beside a beautiful waiting room finished with marble, B.C. native woods and mosaic tiled floors. in 1937 the streetcar system was replaced with buses and the interurban system finally closed in the 1950's. the old station was sold to Wosk's Furniture and Appliance stores LTD [**DNW-is there a photo of this in the archive... the furniture store?**]. In 1954 and the station's handsome design has suffered many unfortunate changes over the years. It is now a Salvation Army location.
