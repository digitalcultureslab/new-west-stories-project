Rushed to completion after the Great Fire, the Windsor Hotel was one of the few wooden structures built on Columbia Street in a city paranoid of potential fires. Designed by architects Guenther and Van-aken in the Victorian Italianate style the building was a proud but old-fashioned block on a street that was proud of its modernity. in 1904 the rooms were $1.00 - $1.50 with a special rate for theatrical parties. The hotel was the first studio for [CKNW radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKNW) from 1944-1950. the station broadcast live to Columbia street via loudspeakers. Although much altered, the hotel retains some later original features such as neon signs from the 1940's marking the separate entrances for "men" and "ladies and escorts".
