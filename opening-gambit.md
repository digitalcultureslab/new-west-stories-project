New West Project - Stories for Mobile App
Student Project to connect dots and make for a compelling story

- Confirm your student rate ($12.00 per hour) - we could do this as an honorarium
- Two weeks? How does that mesh with our timelines? Done by August 21? Start ASAP
- What is the confirmed budget - how much do we have?

Three Tours; 10 stops each.

Historical City Tour
Public Art Tour
Walking Waterfront Tour

- Full access to ask for more or specific content from:
	- tourism
	- the arts council
	- NewWest archives

My thoughts: 

- probably most realistic as a 3-4 week timeline - so, project complete by August 28, 2017
- I will oversea the work and we will pay student in lump sum as independent contractor (depending on budget)

Process: 

- Three boxes; one for each tour. Collect then distribute... allow narrative to emerge.
