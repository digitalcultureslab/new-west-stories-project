**Trapp Block**

This six story building (of which only the fa√ßade remains) was owned by Thomas and Samuel Trapp. The building originally housed a wholesale and retail firm. The firm became one of the most successful wholesale firms in Western Canada by 1914. The Trapp Block is valued for its bold progressive Edwardian Era architecture and helped to  established the historic character of downtown New Westminster. The company later opened another location on front street.

In the photo above, the Trapp Buildingis visible on the right-hand side, with the Edison Theatre a few buildings over. The Trapp block has now been incorporated into the Trapp and Holbrook condominium complex. New Westminster continues to celebrate its history by preserving architectural signs such as the Trapp Block to remember its key people and contributors.
