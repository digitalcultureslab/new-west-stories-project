Trapp Block

The six story building was owned by Thomas and Samuel Trapp. The building was a wholesale and retail firm. The firm became one of the most successful wholesale firms in Western Canada in 1914. The Trapp Block is valued for its bold progressive Edwardian era architecture and helped to  established the historic character in downtown New Westminster. The company later opened another location on front street.
The Trapp block has now been renovated and built housing near the waterfront in New Westminster. It is interesting the way New Westminster celebrates its history by remembering key people.
