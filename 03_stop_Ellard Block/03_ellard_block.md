**The Ellard Block**

Named after James Ellard, a Royal Engineer who stayed in New Westminster after his detachment disbanded in 1863. Built by his estate after his death in 1899, it now houses a Starbucks and a martini bar called Drink Urban Lounge. The Building was designed by a member of the Oddfellows Lodge, whose original building you just visited. The Architects, Clow and Welsh built many of the buildings in New Westminster's downtown core after the Great Fire.
