The Depot was built in 1910-11 by the [B.C. Electric Railway Company](http://www.r2parks.net/BCE.html) as the hub for the electric Interurban railway system between Vancouver and Chilliwack. Architects Maclure and Fox modelled its design on the [Indiana Traction Company's station in Indianapolis Indiana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Indianapolis_Traction_and_Terminal_Company%27s_main_Terminal.jpg). 

Completed at a cost of $100,000, this handsome Edwardian Classical revival styled station was engineered in structural steel to permit the addition of two extra stories in the future. Interurban cars entered diagonally through the building to platforms beside a beautiful waiting room finished with marble, B.C. native woods and mosaic tiled floors.

In 1937, the streetcar system was replaced with buses and the B.C. Electric Interurban System finally closed in the 1950s. Since 1954, the old Depot has been a retail location.
