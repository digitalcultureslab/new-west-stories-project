Federal Building and Post Office. 

in 1860 the Royal Engineers built eh first colonial government offices on this site. In 1883 a brick Post Office was built and the stately City Library was constructed in 1891. These buildings were destroyed in the Great Fire and replaced the following yet with the imposing Dominion Buildings well as a new city Hall. in 1930 a large granite and sandstone modern-styled addition was added to the rear of the old dominion building facing 6th street in anticipation of its planned demolition. Finally, after much delay the new federal building was completed in 1958 adjoining the 1939 addition. Purchased by the City of New Westminster in 2000, it is now the police station on the bottom two floors with loft condos on the upper 3, with the addition of penthouse level.
