**Anvil Centre**

The history walk starts here. 

The walk will take you here.

Looking East, toward the high-rise condominiums on the right-hand, or water, side of Columbia Street, you can see the white fa√ßade of the old Trapp building ("Trapp" is written on the front of it). This building, built in XXXX, will orient you throughout the walk. Across the street is the Westminster Trust building, with a Waves Coffee shop in it. That's another good orienting landmark. Both are older than the awesome new Anvil Centre where you find yourself now.

In the photo, the large "CAFE" sign is roughly your position right now, with the Train station across the street, slightly behind us. 

Pictures will try to orient you and narratives are taken from both architectural and personal interest points of view. 

Follow along and find out a few interesting tidbits about New Westminster, Western Canada's first capital.
