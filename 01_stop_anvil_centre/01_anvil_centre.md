**Anvil Centre**

The history walk starts here.

The name of the Anvil Centre harkens back to a New Westminster tradition: Firing the anvil, a traditional Hyack Brigade salute on Queen's Birthday in which gunpowder is placed between two anvils and exploded--the accompanying photo is of an early celebration. 

Officially opened in 2014, the Anvil Centre is designed to accommodate a wide range of events, arts and cultural activities, and City and community-led programs.  Anvil Centre is a vibrant gathering space and is New Westminsterâ€™s newest commercial and cultural hub.

The Anvil Centre is home to: 

- Anvil Conference Centre
- New Westminster Museum & Archives
- Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame
- Tourism New Westminster
- New Westminster New Media Gallery
- Anvil Centre Performing Arts Theatre
- The Community Art Space

The photo above looks east, with the "CAFE" sign roughly the location upon which Anvil Centre now sits. Further along, the Westminster Trust Building is on the left-hand side of the photo--it now has a Waves Coffee Shop in the lobby--and the old British Columbia Electric Railway barn is across the street--it's now a Salvation Army Store with the monument "Wait for Me, Daddy" next to it. 

As you walk East along Columbia St., we'll tell you a little about some of the buildings or historical points of interest along the way. Follow along and find out a few interesting tidbits about New Westminster, British Columbia's first capital.
